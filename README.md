# BreedEZ
1st Year Software Development Project

* Project involved making a dating app-style web application to allow dog breeders to find other breeders. App allows users to create an account, browse through other profiles, filter based on criteria and instant message other users.
* This was a fun project to work on as it allowed my foundational development skills and methods to flourish into what would eventually be a successful piece of coursework. (and it involved gathering many dog photos, which is always a plus)
